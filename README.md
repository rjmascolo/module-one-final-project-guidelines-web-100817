### Basic Design: ###
HII is designed to allow the user to find the health grade history
of a restaurant based on the name and location. Users will also be able to look up
restaurants near them with the most and least violations, and can specify a type
of cuisine if they prefer.

The score of the restaurant is pulled from the NYC health inspection information publicly available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us, as are the violation definitions and codes.

More information about health code assignments can be found here - http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/how-we-score-grade.pdf

### How to Run: ###  
First, make sure to migrate and seed that database using the commands 'rake db:migrate' and 'rake db:seed'.  Seeding may take quite a while, since it's pulling in and crunching a ton of data.

After that, run.rb is your run file. From the command line inside of the project folder 'ruby bin/run.rb' will get you up and running.  The program is simple to operate and merely requires that you follow the on-screen prompts.

*If you'd like to demo the program with a smaller dataset, change the limit at the end of  line 6 of 'api_communicator.rb' to 1000 or 10,000.  We found that it takes about a minute to seed for every 10,000 records.*
